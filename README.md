# Mobile Developer Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to give us a better understanding of your coding skills. If you have any questions or need any clarifications for this challenge, please get in touch!

Estimated time: 1hr. 

## Goal:

#### Develop a Currency Conversion App that allows a user view exchange rates for any given currency

- [ ] Create a Project for a Mobile Phone
- [ ] Android: _Java/Kotlin_ | iOS: _Swift_ (sorry, no Objective-C please!)

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Exchange rates must be fetched from: https://currencylayer.com/documentation  
- [ ] User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies available from the API
- [ ] User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
- [ ] Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)
- [ ] Message the HR coordinator to get a API Access Key for using the API.

### UI Suggestion:
- [ ] Some way to select a currency
- [ ] A list/grid of exchange rates
- [ ] It doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to be functional ;)

### What we're looking for:
- [ ] An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
- [ ] Your coding style! Show us how you like to write your code
- [ ] Architecture, how you've structured your code
- [ ] Principles, how you belive code should be written

### When you're done...

Zip your completed Project and email the .zip file.
If you want to instead make a github repo and just send us a link to it, that's fine too but please do __not__ fork this repo thanks!

Have fun!
